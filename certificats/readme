To set up certificate:


1. Install mkcert: https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation
2. Run: `mkcert -install`
3. Run: `mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1`

(you can also run the ps1 as admin if you have choco or scoop on windows and you want to use that)

Required certificat: localhost.pem + localhost-key.pem
(else nginx generate automatic untrustable certificates)
